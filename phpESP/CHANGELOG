Changes made by Franky on version 1.8.2:

20070615
Added option to disable automatic numbering of questions when showing the survey
Reworked a bit the "!other" anwser for radio/checkbox answers
The answer to numerical questions are now also checked (to see the answer is indeed numerical)

20070412
fixes for losing the session info when changing respondents or designers

uptill 20061201
- multiple fixes, see: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1598273&group_id=8956&atid=308956

I also added the possibility to choose the language in handler.php, either by GET option or by setting a $lang parameter. To do this, I added below the line

> require_once(ESP_BASE . '/admin/phpESP.ini.php');
the next lines:
< if (isset($_REQUEST['lang'])) {
< esp_setlocale_ex($_REQUEST['lang']);
< }
< if (isset($lang)) {
< esp_setlocale_ex($lang);
< }

So now handler.php?lang=nl_NL works, as well as setting $lang="nl_NL" and including handler.php as always.


20061202 (I think)
- added cookie checks to disable double postings (variable limit_double_postings in admin/phpESP.ini.php). It is disabled by default but I recommend you use it.
- You need to use public/phpESP.first.php in every php survey page now (at the beginning, because cookies and sessions are used)

20061205
- added a captcha as well, so no scripted answers are possible (variable use_captcha in admin/phpESP.ini.php). It is disabled by default but I recommend you use it.

20061207 - version 1.8.2e
- implemented captcha abuse prevention mechanism, and updated captcha.README. I'll probably release the captcha as a seperate program as well
- included patch 1609284

2006121011 - version 1.8.2f
- cookies to prevent double posting are no longer set if the survey is in test
- updated the help pages a bit
- added the ability to change the format of the date field, according to http://be.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php (I hope this'll work for everybody)
