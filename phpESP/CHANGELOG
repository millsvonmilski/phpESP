Changes made by Franky on version 1.8.2:

20071126
- bumped the version to 2.0.0 (long overdue)
- Added the posibility to define conditions on a question. See the help page in the admin interface for more info. In short:
A question is only shown when a condition is met.
All conditions are "OR" conditions, so if one conditions is fullfilled, the question is shown.
A question that has a condition must be an optional question. So, if you define a condition on a question, the "Required" parameter is set to "No".
A question that has a condition must be on the next page than the question/value that is used to compare it with. Use the "Order tab" to insert a section break where wanted (this is NOT done automatically).

- Discovered the page admin/manage.php?where=purge, to purge a survey
- Added the possibility to purge a response from a survey (only superuser can do this): admin/manage.php?where=response_purge
- You can now configure the mail address used by phpesp when sending mails


20071107
- Correct LDAP auth, authenticated users are no longer recreated in the DB
- You can choose between LDAP authentication for respondents, designers or both
- Fixed some session checks when already logged in
- Fixed some typo's (why did nobody see these???)

20070615
Added option to disable automatic numbering of questions when showing the survey
Reworked a bit the "!other" anwser for radio/checkbox answers
The answer to numerical questions are now also checked (to see the answer is indeed numerical)

20070412
fixes for losing the session info when changing respondents or designers

uptill 20061201
- multiple fixes, see: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1598273&group_id=8956&atid=308956

I also added the possibility to choose the language in handler.php, either by GET option or by setting a $lang parameter. To do this, I added below the line

> require_once(ESP_BASE . '/admin/phpESP.ini.php');
the next lines:
< if (isset($_REQUEST['lang'])) {
< esp_setlocale_ex($_REQUEST['lang']);
< }
< if (isset($lang)) {
< esp_setlocale_ex($lang);
< }

So now handler.php?lang=nl_NL works, as well as setting $lang="nl_NL" and including handler.php as always.


20061202 (I think)
- added cookie checks to disable double postings (variable limit_double_postings in admin/phpESP.ini.php). It is disabled by default but I recommend you use it.
- You need to use public/phpESP.first.php in every php survey page now (at the beginning, because cookies and sessions are used)

20061205
- added a captcha as well, so no scripted answers are possible (variable use_captcha in admin/phpESP.ini.php). It is disabled by default but I recommend you use it.

20061207 - version 1.8.2e
- implemented captcha abuse prevention mechanism, and updated captcha.README. I'll probably release the captcha as a seperate program as well
- included patch 1609284

2006121011 - version 1.8.2f
- cookies to prevent double posting are no longer set if the survey is in test
- updated the help pages a bit
- added the ability to change the format of the date field, according to http://be.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php (I hope this'll work for everybody)
