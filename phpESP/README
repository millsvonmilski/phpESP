phpESP.sql:		SQL script to initialize your mysql database for phpESP
update.sql:		SQL script if you are upgrading (read the contents)
espauth.sql:	SQL script to create authentication tables 
				(see README.AUTH)

PREREQUISITES:
  * mysql installed and running
  * web server with PHP4 installed and configured for .php files
    (I built and tested with Apache/1.3.12 + PHP4.0.1pl2)
  * read the license

INSTALLING:

  Unpack the archive somewhere in your htdocs dir. (now referred to
  [install-root])

  Create a new mysql database, and a mysql user with
  select,insert,update,delete privileges on the database.

  From a privileged mysql account import the file [install-root]/phpESP.sql to
  initialize the survey database.

  Edit the file [install-root]/admin/phpESP.ini and set the paths according to
  where you installed phpESP, and the path to it on your website. Set the
  database info.
  
  Edit the file [install-root]/public/handler.php and set the path
  to where the phpESP.ini is.

  Edit the [install-root]/admin/.htaccess file to set the access permission for
  the administration side. Or just set the path to use the current auth method.
  By default the .htpasswd file contains one user 'root' with a password of
  'esp'. CHANGE THE DEFAULT, by running:
     /usr/local/apache/bin/htpasswd .htpasswd root
  from the admin directory. (Substitute your path to apache
  above if different.)

  Load the admin site in your browser, and go! Further docs provided from the
  help page on the admin site. Depending on where you installed phpESP the
  admin site should be at --
    http://127.0.0.1/[path-to-install-in-htdocs]/phpESP/admin/

  Read the UPGRADE guide even if you are not upgrading. I put some more help
  on new features in there (tho not much).

  If you have problems, questions, suggestion, patches, flames feel free to
  email me. (See top of this doc, or sourceforge to get my email address.)
