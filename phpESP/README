FILES:

public/:		public interface to taking surveys
LICENSE:		the license, read this!
phpESP.sql:		SQL script to initialize your mysql database for phpESP

PREREQUISITES:
  * mysql installed and running
  * web server with PHP4 installed and configured for .php files
    (I built and tested with Apache/1.3.12 + PHP4.0.1pl2)
  * read the license

INSTALLING:
  You may install this package in any place you wish,
  however the recommended location is in:
    /usr/local/lib/php/contrib/phpESP
  By doing so, you can avoid editing so many files to point
  them at the rest of the files.

  Unpack the archive in the directory that you choose.
  (From now on  referred to as the [install-root].) Now
  you  need to place a few files somewhere inside your
  htdocs tree. Symlink (or copy) the [install-root]/images
  directory to somewhere in the htdocs tree.

  Edit the file [install-root]/admin/phpESP.ini and set the
  paths according to where you installed phpESP, and the
  path to the images on your web site. Set the database
  info.

  Edit the file [install-root]/admin/manage.php and set the
  path to where the phpESP.ini is.  Then symlink (or copy)
  it to somewhere in the htdocs tree as index.php or
  whatever you wish. 

  Edit the file [install-root]/public/handler*.php and set
  the path to where the phpESP.ini is.

  Create a new mysql database, and a mysql user with
  select,insert,update,delete privileges on the database.

  From a privileged mysql account import the file
  [install-root]/phpESP.sql to initialize the survey
  database.

  Load the admin site in your browser, and go! Further docs
  provided from the help page on the admin site. The
  default login is root/esp. I suggest you change the
  password for this account right away.

  If you have problems, questions, suggestion, patches,
  flames feel free to email me. (See top of this doc, or
  SourceForge to get my email address.)
