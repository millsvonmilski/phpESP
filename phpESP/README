phpESP is a package for PHP that provides an easy to use
web-based interface to designing surveys, deploying them on
your web site, and exporting data. It features multiple
users and user groups, with data isolation and hiding
between groups. It is suitable for use by a single person,
a  department, or an entire organization. The surveys
created by phpESP can be easily embedded into existing HTML
templates with one or two new lines.

============================================================
FILES:
admin/:        administration interface and files
images/:       gifs used by the package

LICENSE:       the license, read this!
phpESP.sql:    SQL script to initialize your mysql database for phpESP

PREREQUISITES:
  * mysql installed and running
  * web server with PHP4 installed and configured for .php files
    suggested: Apache 1.3+ with PHP 4.1+
  * read the license

INSTALLING:
  You may install this package in any place you wish,
  however the recommended location is in:
    /usr/local/lib/php/contrib/phpESP
  By doing so, you can avoid editing pathnames in the
  sources.

  Unpack the archive in the directory that you choose.
  (From now on  referred to as the [install-root].) Now
  you need to place a few files somewhere inside your
  htdocs tree. Symlink (or copy) the [install-root]/images
  directory to somewhere in the htdocs tree.

  Edit the file [install-root]/admin/phpESP.ini and set the
  paths according to where you installed phpESP, and the
  path to the images on your web site. Set the database
  info.

  Edit the file [install-root]/admin/manage.php and set the
  path to where the phpESP.ini is.  Then symlink (or copy)
  it to somewhere in the htdocs tree as index.php or
  whatever you wish. This is used to access the
  administrative interface to phpESP. All users who will be
  creating survyes will need access to this URL.

  Edit the files [install-root]/public/handler*.php and set
  the path to where the phpESP.ini is.

  Create a new mysql database, and a mysql user with
  select,insert,update,delete privileges on the database.

  From a privileged mysql account import the file
  [install-root]/phpESP.sql to initialize the survey
  database. To do this from the command line do the
  following:
    $ mysql -uroot -p phpesp < [install-root]/phpESP.sql
  Where "root" is a privileged mysql account, and "phpesp"
  is the name of the database you created in the previous
  step.

  Load the admin site in your browser, and go! Further docs
  provided from the help page on the admin site. The
  default login is root/esp. I suggest you change the
  password for this account right away.
