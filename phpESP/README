phpESP is a package for PHP that provides an easy to use
web-based interface to designing surveys, deploying them on
your web site, and exporting data. It features multiple
users and user groups, with data isolation and hiding
between groups. It is suitable for use by a single person,
a  department, or an entire organization. The surveys
created by phpESP can be easily embedded into existing HTML
templates with one or two new lines.

phpESP.sql:    SQL script to initialize your mysql database for phpESP

PREREQUISITES:
  * mysql installed and running
  * web server with PHP4 installed and configured for .php files
    suggested: Apache 1.3+ with PHP 4.1+ (module, *not* CGI)
  * read the license

INSTALLING:
  If you are upgrading from a previous version, please
  read the UPGRADING section below.

  You may install this package in any place you wish,
  however the recommended location is in:
    /usr/local/lib/php/contrib/phpESP
  By doing so, you can avoid editing pathnames in the
  sources.

  Unpack the archive in the directory that you choose.
  (From now on  referred to as the [install-root].) Do
  *not* unpack phpESP inside your htdocs (or personal
  public_html directory etc), doing so means that your
  config file will be readable by anyone on the web (it
  will have your database password in it). Now you need to
  place a few files somewhere inside your htdocs tree.
  Symlink (or copy) the [install-root]/images directory to
  somewhere in the htdocs tree.

  Edit the file [install-root]/admin/phpESP.ini and set the
  paths according to where you installed phpESP, and the
  path to the images on your web site. Set the database
  info.

  Edit the file [install-root]/admin/manage.php and set the
  path to where the phpESP.ini is.  Then symlink (or copy)
  it to somewhere in the htdocs tree as index.php or
  whatever you wish. This is used to access the
  administrative interface to phpESP. All users who will be
  creating surveys will need access to this URL.

  Edit the files [install-root]/public/handler*.php and set
  the path to where the phpESP.ini is.

  Edit the file [install-root]/public/survey.php and set the
  path to where phpESP.ini is.

  Create a new mysql database, and a mysql user with
  select,insert,update,delete privileges on the database.

  From a privileged mysql account import the file
  [install-root]/phpESP.sql to initialize the survey
  database. To do this from the command line do the
  following:
    $ mysql -uroot -p phpesp < [install-root]/phpESP.sql
  Where "root" is a privileged mysql account, and "phpesp"
  is the name of the database you created in the previous
  step.

  Load the admin site in your browser, and go! Further docs
  provided from the help page on the admin site. The
  default login is root/esp. I suggest you change the
  password for this account right away.

  If you have problems, questions, suggestion, flames feel
  free to join the phpesp-general mailing list. You can
  join from the following URL:
  http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/phpesp-general
  
  If you have patches or want to help develop, please join
  the phpesp-devel mailing list. You can join from the following
  URL:
  http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/phpesp-devel

UPGRADING:
  Upgrading from versions before v1.3 is not recommended.
  If you are using a version older than v1.3, it is
  recommended you install this new version in a separate
  database.
  
  If you are upgrading from v1.3, you must execute the
  following SQL statement in order to make use of the new
  "Section Text" question type:
    INSERT INTO question_type VALUES ('100','Section Text','N','');
