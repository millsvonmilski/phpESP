SOON:
* "sub"-questions of other questions
  (Roman, will this solve the SKIP problem?)
* "forked" surveys (subsequent pages dependant on previous question)
* question groups (questions that share a Q#)
* check boxes with a fixed number (pick N items...)
* javascript '!other' helper
* sub headings/text within survey
* spell checking support (use spell checking from IMP?)
* "Archive" managemnet
* move text strings to seperate file (to ease LOCALE support)
* javascript 'order' page
* javascript conditional questions (sub questions)
* delete button on questions tab
* CSV export function

LATER:
* results (user vs. admin)
* fix results math ;-)
* results w/o Total's option
* user login/verification etc.
* add "parameters" to question types (?)
  * Enable/Disable "N/A" on ratings
* view results per submission
* new GUI
* better docs

NEVER: :)  Well OK, not never. 
           I'll do this when I write a new templating engine.
* add LOCALE support
