SOON:
* expand the "Results" page into "Analysis"
  * including a nice form interface to the cross-analysis
* "sub"-questions of other questions
* "forked" surveys (subsequent pages dependent on previous question)
* question groups (questions that share a Q#)
* check boxes with a fixed number (pick N items...)
* sub headings/text within survey
* spell checking support (use spell checking from IMP?)
* "Archive" management
* merging survey results
* fix email functions

LATER:
* results (user vs. admin)
* view results per submission
* new GUI
* better docs

NEVER: :)  Well OK, not never. 
           I'll do this when I write a new template engine.
* add LOCALE support

JAVASCRIPTS: (please contribute)
 * Automatically Check box (or radio button) next
   to an "!other" field when data is entered.
 * Limit number of check boxes checked to N.
 * "Grey out" a field(s) when a box is/is not checked.
 * Numeric only text fields (Denis HAVLIK <denis@mandrakesoft.com>)
