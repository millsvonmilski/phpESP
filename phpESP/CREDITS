This software was initially written for eGrad2000.com. I
would like to thank everyone there and their commitment to
open source software.

Further development past version 1.0 has been a product of
my "spare time". I would like to thank college for all the
spare time and the bandwidth. ;-)

Additonal help in ideas, criticisim, testing, and code from
Romans Jasins <roma@latnet.lv>. Thanks Roma, especially for
the Javascript and HTML help. Get some sleep!
