p h p E S P   (php Easy Survey Package)
============================================================
$Id$

This software was initially written for eGrad2000.com. I
would like to thank everyone there and their commitment to
open source software.

Further development past version 1.0 has been a product of
my "spare time". I would like to thank college for all the
spare time and the bandwidth. ;-)

Additional help in ideas, criticism, testing, and code from
Romans Jasins <roma at latnet.lv>. Thanks Roma, especially
for the Javascript and HTML help. Get some sleep!

Additional development including authentication
enhancements and CSV export were written for The
University of Vermont.

Patches for adding "Section Text" to surveys were provided
by Kon Angelopoulos <angekgabiel at iprimus.com.au>.

Additional development by The ITLab <www.itlab.musc.edu>

If you have made any significant enhancements or changes to
phpESP please contribute back.
