========================================================================
$Id$

This software was initially written for eGrad.com.  I would like to
thank everyone there and their commitment to open source software.

Further development past version 1.0 has been a product of my "spare
time".  I would like to thank college for all the spare time and the
bandwidth. ;-)

Additional help in ideas, criticism, testing, and code from Romans
Jasins <roma at latnet.lv>.  Thanks Roma, especially for the Javascript
and HTML help. Get some sleep!

Authentication enhancements and CSV export additions were sponsored by
The University of Vermont.

The "Section Text" enhancements, survey themes, and cross analysis GUI
were provided by Kon Angelopoulos <angekgabiel at iprimus.com.au>.

Additional development by The ITLab <www.itlab.musc.edu>

If you have made any significant enhancements or changes to phpESP
please contribute back.
