<p><a name="1"><b>How do you display only 1 question per page? </b></a>
<p>
You can put a section break between each question to emulate this behavior.

<p><a name="2"><b>Can you prevent multiple votes (ballot stuffing)? </b></a>
<p class="indented">
Well, if you give each respondent a username and password and have them login, you can limit 
multiple voting.  If you don't force respondents to log in, it becomes more difficult (e.g., you could 
analyze the data by IP.)

<p><a name="3"><b>Do register globals need to be on? </b></a>
<p class="indented">No.

<p><a name="4"><b>Can you limit the number of times someone takes a survey if they have to login? </b></a>
<p class="indented">Yes, set max login to the number of times you want to allow someone to take the survey.

<p><a name="5"><b>Linux 500 error shows when my permissions are set to 771.  What now? </b></a>
<p class="indented">Try making permissions 644; they must be readable by apache so the PHP engine
can run them.

<p><a name="6"><b>Can a responder complete part of a survey, log out, then log back in later to finish? </b></a>
<p class="indented">No, you should break the survey into two smaller surveys.
<br>
<a href="#top">Top</a> 
<p><a name="7"><b>Can phpESP support large numbers of respondents?</b></a>
<p class="indented"../../home/viola/>Yes, large surveys (100 questions) and large respondent groups (4,000+) can be 
handled without a problem.  Throughput issues are generally a function of how fast is your web server, 
how fast is the mysql server, and what bandwidth access is there to your servers.
<br>
<a href="#top">Top</a> 
<p><a name="8"><b>Do you support other databases than mysql?</b></a>
<p class="indented">Not currently.  We'd welcome help doing that if you have the time.
<br>

<p><a name="9"><b>I'm running Windows and keep getting a blank screen-Help! </b></a>
<p class="indented">If is is not a pathing problem in phpESP.ini, then copy gnu_gettext.dll and 
php_gettext.dll (both usually found in the PHP install directory) into the system director of windows.  For
Win95/98 the system directory is something like c:/winroot/system and on WinNT/2000/XP the system 
directory is something like c:/winroot/system32.<br>
<br>After you have copied these dll's to the proper place, edit your php.ini file and comment out the 
line "extension=php_gettext.dll". <br>
<br>Last thing you do is stop and restart your server.
<br>

<p><a name="10"><b>Can you delete old surveys? </b></a>
<p class="indented">Yes--need to tell them how 
<br>
<a href="#top">Top</a> 
<p><a name="11"><b>Can you delete the data for old surveys? </b></a>
<p class="indented">Yes, there is an unlisted function http://......./phpESP/admin/manage.php?where=purge<br>
Be carefule when using it, you can't recover from it.
<br>
<a href="#top">Top</a> 
<p><a name="12"><b>Where do you set the mysql login passwords?</b></a>
<p class="indented">You set the password, user, and database connections that phpESP will use with 
mysql in the file phpESP.ini -- further details are in the README file.
<br>
<a href="#top">Top</a> 
<p><a name="13"><b>Can you change the number of options on a rank question? </b></a>
<p class="indented">Yes, change the length field.
<br>
<a href="#top">Top</a> 
<p><a name="14"><b>I'm having trouble changing the default language, what should I do? </b></a>
<p class="indented">You need to put somethine relevant here.  http://phpesp.sf.net/files/status.php.txt
seemed like an important url in the mail lists.
