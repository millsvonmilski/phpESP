HACKING PHPESP: A Developer's Guide
===================================

This document contains a guide to the phpESP source code, and how to
get started as a developer.


OBTAINING PHPESP FROM CVS
-------------------------

phpESP comes in three flavors: there are stable release versions,
development (or beta) release versions, and the phpESP cvs tree.  Most
developers work directly with the most current sources in the cvs
tree.  In order to check out a working copy from the cvs tree, you must
have a cvs client.  You can login to the cvs server as "anonymous" to
get read-only access with the following command (all one line):

  $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpesp.sourceforge.net:/cvshome/phpesp
        login

The password is empty, so just press enter at the prompt.  Once you are
logged in, you can obtain a working copy of phpESP with the following
command (also all on one line):

  $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpesp.sourceforge.net:/cvshome/phpesp
        co phpESP

This will create a directory called "phpESP", which will contain the 
current sources.  You may work with these files by whatever means you
wish.  You may also use cvs commands within this directory to interact
with the cvs tree.  For example, to generate a patch including all
changes you have made to the source locally, you would execute (from
the "phpESP" directory):

  $ cvs diff -u

The output, called a unified diff, is the preferred format for sending
patches to the development team.  If you are not familiar with cvs, you
may read more about it at the following web site:
