****** IMPORTANT ******
This is a developmental release.  Do not use this on your production phpESP database.
We are now using ADODB and have made significant changes to the database API which
may cause unknown data corruption.  Please create a fresh phpESP database instance and
help us workout any remaining bugs.

UPDATING PHPESP
===============

This document contains instructions for updating an existing
installation of phpESP to a more recent version.  Please see the
INSTALL guide for instructions on obtaining phpESP.


GETTING STARTED
---------------

As of version 1.6, phpESP no longer requires editing paths as previous
versions did.  The recommended upgrade path is to  rename the old
install directory, and install the new version in the old location
(following the directions in INSTALL).  The database creation and
population steps should be skipped, and in place follow the
instructions below on updating the database.  Once the new version is
installed and running, you may delete the old install directory.

For example if you had phpESP 1.5 installed in

  /usr/local/www/htdocs/phpESP

You should do something like this

  $ cd /usr/local/www/htdocs
  $ mv phpESP phpESP.old
  $ tar -zxf /path/to/phpESP-1.6.tar.gz
  $ mv phpESP-1.6 phpESP
  ... configure phpESP 1.6 ...
  ... update database ...
  ... test phpESP 1.6 ...
  $ rm -rf phpESP.old


BACKING UP OLD DATABASE
-----------------------

Before updating, it is recommended that you dump a copy of the phpESP
database.  Please consult the MySQL documentation on how to dump a
database.


UPDATING DATABASE
-----------------

Go into the dir scripts/db and run the following mysql statements on your database (run all updates that are needed in the correct sequence):

mysql_update-1.5-1.6.sql (if still running 1.5)
mysql_update-1.8.2h-1.8.2i.sql (if running a version <= 1.8.2h and going to 1.8.2i)
mysql_update-1.8.2k-2.0.0.sql (if running a version 1.8.2i-1.8.2k and going to 2.0.0)

Please execute the update script as follows:
  $ mysql -u root -p phpesp < scripts/db/mysql_update-1.8.2h-1.8.2i.sql
  $ mysql -u root -p phpesp < scripts/db/mysql_update-1.8.2k-2.0.0.sql
Change "root" by the correct DB user and "phpesp" by the correct DB name.

Once you move to mySQL 4.1 you cannot downgrade your mySQL back to 4.0 
or below and expect phpESP to function.
