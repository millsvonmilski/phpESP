UPGRADE GUIDE: [v1.0 to v1.1]

For the most part, this version does not require changes. The major
change is the change from rank questions to rating questions. If you
have any surveys with Rank questions you will have to change them, so
don't do the upgrade while you have active surveys.

There are small database changes with this version. I have included a
'upgrade.sql' script that will alter your existing database, and
preserve your data. The only issue is that the 'Rank' question gets
deleted, so editing,testing,taking,results from surveys with those
types of questions will be effected. I haven't completly tested how
each is handled, but you should be able to use active ones, and view
the results. If you edit them, you will have to delete any questions of
that type.

If you have questions about the upgrade process, email me.
